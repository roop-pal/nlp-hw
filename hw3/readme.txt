### Problem 5

The precision, recall, and f1-score were 0.713. This code runs relatively slowly, only completing 4.27 iterations /
second. The accuracy was not terrible but also not impressive. I think the accuracy could be improved by sectioning the
`_RARE_` words into more specific categories (as done in homework 1).

### Problem 6

The precision, recall, and f1-score were 0.742. The accuracy is better than in problem 5, which is expected due to
vertical markovization. The runtime is significantly slower, at 1.47 iterations / second, but the problem is still
tractable.
